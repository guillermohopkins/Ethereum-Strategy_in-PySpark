# Ethereum_Strategy_in-PySpark
This project was part of a Group Assingment for the Modern Data Architectures II class, and it had the goal of developing an investment vector to trade Ethereum.

The main idea of the project is to predicte the close price of Ethereum with an Autoregressive model and setting long and short positions, ingesting the data with Python and the Binance API, storing it in HDFS and processing with Apache Spark MLlib.
